                p
                  | #[a(href="https://rladies.org/") R-Ladies] is a global organisation that aims to promote gender diversity in the R community by creating a network of R users, mainly through local meetup chapters. There are currently over more than #[a(href="https://gqueiroz.shinyapps.io/rshinylady/") 40 countries] R-Ladies chapters worldwide. Additionally, there are many more R-Ladies that do not have a chapter nearby, but use R and identify as women or gender minorities.
                p
                  | To facilitate communication and enable networking in a safe environment among all R-Ladies worldwide this Slack was created.

                p
                  b Who is an “R-Lady”?
                p
                  | We define an “R-Lady” as an R user that identifies as a woman or gender minority.
                p
                  b Why is this Slack for women and gender minorities only? 
                p
                  | The mission of R-Ladies is to increase gender diversity in the R community. One way to achieve this, is, to provide a safe space where genders currently underrepresented in the R community feel at ease to exchange and collectively progress. We believe that by offering such a safe space, we can contribute to a harassment-free, welcoming, friendly and safe community. 
                p
                  b Does this also mean that R-Ladies meetups are for women and gender minorities only? 
                p
                  | Most R-Ladies chapters have the policy that organisers and presenters are women or gender minorities, but welcome allies to participate in meetups as guest. Each chapter has a contact email address and we encourage you to contact the meetup organizers if something is unclear. 
                p
                  b Gender neutral language
                p
                  | We would like to encourage gender neutral language in this Slack. Depending on context, addressing someone as “ladies” or “guys” might not be gender neutral. There are plenty reasons for a preference of being addressed in a gender neutral way and we would like to respect that.
