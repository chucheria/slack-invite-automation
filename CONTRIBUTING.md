The code is written in [jade](http://jade-lang.com/). Jade is a Node template engine which simplifies writing HTML. You don't need to be fluent in jade to change the APP (depending on what you want to achieve, as always), take a look at what is already done and replicate.

## Change text

To change the text go to [`views > index.jade`](views/index.jade). 

## Change style

To change styles go to [`public > css > style.css`](public/css/style.css)
